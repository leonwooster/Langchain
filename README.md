<h1>A Langchain playground</h1>
<p>
I used this project to create POCs concepts that are related to OpenAI LLM(ChatGPT) and making use of the vailable agents to automate some of the impossible processes in the past.

Note: Remember to include your own .env file with the following info
OPENAI_API_KEY= <<Key for ChatGPT>>
SERPAPI_API_KEY = <<Key for scrapper engine>>
